## About
I had a bit of free time in the beginning of my new college quarter and I had just gained better knowledge of Vector math. That knowledge combined with a want to keep my C programming skills up and a need to update my Unity skills led to this whole project.

## Goals
I had goals going into this project for what I wanted to learn or do with this project.
These goals were to:
+ Learn the new Player Input System
+ Base the Player Ball's entire movement off the physics engine
+ Create a Dynamic Camera system
+ Have a Non-Photo Realistic (NPR) style for the visuals
+ Allow for fast fluid movement

## Player Movement
This was the hardest


## Usage

Add notes about how to use the system.
